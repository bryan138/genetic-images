# Genetic Images

This is a program that uses a genetic evolutionary algorithm to recreate an image using only circles of different sizes, colors, positions and alphas. As an example, this are some samples produced with the algorithm:

### Whatâ€™s Next?
The existing functional version is implemented in Python and takes quite a bit of time to produce noteworthy results, so the immediate next step is to work in its efficiency. I will make an exact copy of the algorithm in C++ to compare performance between languages. Once it's in C++ several more performance and functionality improvements will be implemented.

Ultimately I plan to do an animation in Processing that, once the algorithm has produced the desired results, takes the raw data for all the circles from a database and creates a neat animation that shows the evolution process in a short period of time.
